Some text, and some `code` and then a nice plain [link with title](https://weitblick.org "title text!").

And a [local link to another chapter]({{< ref "../chapter-2.md" >}})

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

{{< image src="image-1-1.jpg" caption="test image 1-1" >}}

{{< image src="image-1-2.jpg" caption="test image 1-2" >}}
